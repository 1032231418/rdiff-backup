Description: incremental backups using binary deltas
 rdiff-backup is a script that backs up one directory to another. The target
 directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are
 stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still
 recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of
 a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories,
 symlinks, special files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it is running as
 root), and modification times. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth
 efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh
 to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences
 will be transmitted.
